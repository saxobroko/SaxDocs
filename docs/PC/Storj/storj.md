Storj is a service I run on my computer. It makes money by renting the spare money on my hard drive. I can't get into to much detail about what it does or hot to use it, because I barely know. SO this page will mostly just be issues i've faced.

##How to start/stop
1. Open task manager
2. Go to services tab
3. Scroll down to "storagenode"
4. Right click and click "start" or "stop"

###If it doesn't start
1. Google "what is my ip"
2. Go to [Cloudflare](cloudflare.md)
