This page will outline how I do my savings, as well as what services and accounts I use.

Macquarie Bank is the main bank I use day-to-day, it currently (25/08/2024) has a 4.75% interest rate on all accounts, making it ideal for spending and saving. <img width="65%" src="/Finance/macquarie.jpg">

As you can see in the above image I have 6 accounts. 

The "Savings (Use)" account is where I put 50% (total weekly pay) or the entirety of my McDonald's weekly paycheck. It is limited to $5000 where the rest gets redirected to my "Savings (Don't Use)" account


The "Savings (Don't Use)" account is where I put 50% (total weekly pay) or the entirety of my Woolworth's weekly paycheck. I arbitrarily limit it to $15,000 where the rest goes into my #Blossom investing account. On this account I am only allowed to transfer money out in emergency situations, such as if the "Savings (Use)" account gets to $0 and I am unable to pay my credit card or other bill. Every month $1000 is transfered to my Emergency account.

You may notice that my Emergency account has $0 despite saying 24k on it. This is because for the time being atleast a different bank is offering a higher interest rate, so for the month the entire emergency account will reside in that bank. <img width="65%" src="/Finance/ubank.jpg">

Every month I will check again on the "Finder" app which savings account has the highest interest rate for the lowest possible effort. By that I mean no silly requirements like using a transaction account 5 times.
