This page will outline how I do my savings, as well as what services and accounts I use.

Macquarie Bank is the main bank I use day-to-day, it currently (25/08/2024) has a 4.75% interest rate on all accounts, making it ideal for spending and saving. <img width="65%" src="/Finance/macquarie.jpg">

As you can see in the above image I have 6 accounts.
