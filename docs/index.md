# Intro to SaxDocs

Originally I started this to make it easy to solve issues I have with my server, PC, and whatnot. However i've decided that this can be where I store my collective knowledge on... Everything?

This might be the start of a many years long journey to write down. Every bit of information I know. Maybe i'll even include stories.

Starting with every single number I know. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.... okay maybe not that in depth.

I imagine this will be the closest thing to scanning a brain that I'm going to get in my lifetime.
