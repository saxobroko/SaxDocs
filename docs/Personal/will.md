This document will outline what happens to all of my possessions. Including but not limited to PC, server, clothes, money, car.

All of my technology (Phone, PC, Server.) should be given to my brother Ryan. Under the condition that he is not allowed to sell any of it, and he understands or learns how to use them. He may use these docs for guidance. Up until that point it will be held and left unused.

My money should not reach any of my family members. Instead it should be given evenly to my child(ren) once they turn 20 assuming they're familiar with the finance section of these docs or if I don't have any, donated in it's entirety to a charity chosen by my spouse or if none my immediate family.

All remaining belongings can be claimed by anyone related to me with the common ancestor of Glenda or Lynette. Anything remaining after being offered must be donated or recycled. Materials not fit for recycling or donation can be used as fuel for a fire at a family gathering.

It should be noted that whoever ends up going through my photos, will see things they don't want to see.
