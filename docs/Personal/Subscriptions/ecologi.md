I am committed to sustainability and actively use Ecologi to offset my carbon footprint. By leveraging Ecologi’s programs, I offset more than four times my total annual carbon emissions, amounting to 20 tonnes of CO2. This impressive feat is achieved through various offset programs I fund, rather than relying solely on tree planting. Additionally, Ecologi’s initiatives support local economies, further enhancing the positive impact. This approach ensures that I not only achieve my carbon-positive goals but also contribute to broader environmental and social benefits.

I could've opted for an Australian business thereby saving money with tax, however I haven't been able to find one good enough.

After writing this i've switched to [Greenfleet CarbonCover 365](https://www.greenfleet.com.au/pages/carbon-cover-365) only for Australian Tax purposes
