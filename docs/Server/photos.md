Since Google Photos removed the free option in like 2019. I did a google takeout of all my photos. Coincidentally my google account was taken over by hackers in that same year after I had already downloaded all my photos. Since then i've had a copy of all my photos sitting safely on my server.

The program I use for a google photos-like experience is the built-in Synology Photos app. I've tried many alternatives and this one always just seems to work with no issues.

##Setup
1. Open Package manager on [DSM](dsm.md)
2. Search for Synology Photos
3. Install
4. Open it's link?

##Uploading Photos from iOS
1. Open Synology Photos app
2. Wait for it to upload 

##Accessing Photos

The login is the same as [DSM](dsm.md)
